# Introduction
  A record of waterbird abundance can tell us more than about just the species themselves, it can also give an indicator of the health of the wetland ecosystem that these birds live in (Kingsford & Porter 2009). In this study I analyse waterbird observations from the National Waterbird Survey to find trends in bird abundance; whether populations are stable, increasing, or decreasing. 
  I first determined which wetlands have sufficient observations to undertake a rigorous analysis, creating a table of the top ten wetlands based on the number of observations.

```{r load-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
bird <- read.csv(file = "data/Waterbird.csv", header = T)

top_observations <- bird %>%
  count(Wetland) %>% #count the number of observations for each wetland
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% #arrange with highest numbers at top
  filter(Wetland != "Unnamed Wetlands") %>% #remove missing values
  top_n(10) %>% #limit to 10 entries
  kable("html", #clean up the table
  col.names = c("Wetland", "Observations"), #rename columns
  caption = "Top wetlands by # of observations") %>% #table title
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options="condensed", position="left") #text positions

top_observations

```
  I chose to focus this study on Lake Moondarra, an artificial lake in northern Queensland created by the Leichhardt Dam. This lake provides water to nearby population and mining lease, as well as habitat for diverse bird species. Long-term analysis of freshwater biota such as waterbirds can indicate the impact of water resource development on ecosystem level change (Kingsford et al, 2017). I investigated population trends at Lake Moondarra wetlands in Queensland, Australia using data that covered 35 years of waterbird observations (1983 - 2018). I predict that bird species are experiencing a long-term decline at Lake Moondarra.

```{r lake moondarra, fig.cap="Lake Moondarra sunset. Source: outbackqueensland.com.au", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("data/moondarra.JPG")

moondarra <- bird %>%
  filter(Wetland == "Lake Moondarra")
```
## Bird abundance in one year
  In 2016, at Lake Moondarra there were a total of 772 observations of unique birds. Of these, Little Black Cormorant was the most abundant species (277 observations), followed by Pelicans (170 observations). 

```{r bird-abundance, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

moon16 <- bird %>% #read in main df
  filter(Wetland == "Lake Moondarra" & Year == 2016) %>% #filter for target wetland & year
  group_by(Common.Name) %>% #group by species
  summarise(sum=sum(Bird.Count)) #find sum of each species during target year

plot16 <- moon16 %>% #read in target wetland/year df
  mutate(Species=as.factor(Common.Name), #rename column
  Species=fct_reorder( Species, sum, .desc=F)) %>% #re-order species by sum
  dplyr::select(-Common.Name) %>% #remove duplicate column
  ggplot( aes(y=Species, x=sum)) + #call main plot
  geom_linerange( aes(xmin=0, xmax=sum, y=Species, colour=Species), #create line element
                  show.legend=F) + #remove redundant legend
  geom_point( aes(colour=Species), position=position_dodge(.5), size=2, show.legend=F) +
  geom_text(aes(label = sum), nudge_x = 10) + #add text for sum for clarity
  labs(title="Bird observations in Lake Moondarra",
       subtitle="Total count per species in 2016",
       x="Observations", y="Bird Species") +
  theme_minimal()

plot16
```

## Trends in waterbird abundance
In order to determine trends in total waterbird abundance, I used a linear regression of sum of all waterbird observations predicted by year of survey. I checked assumptions using the plot function and found that residuals were evenly dispersed and followed the QQ-plot.

```{r waterbirds-analytical-methods, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#find the total abundance of birds per year at Lake Moondarra
moon_total <- bird %>%
  filter(Wetland == "Lake Moondarra") %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(sum=sum(Bird.Count))

#find equation for the regression line
moon.lm <- lm(sum ~ Year, #sum predicted by year
              data = moon_total)

#checking assumptions
plot(moon.lm)
```

# Results


## Waterbird abundance at Lake Moondarra
The abundance of waterbirds has been decreasing at Lake Moondarra across the years surveyed (F=5.33, R-squared=0.11, p=0.03). The results of this model are visualised , showing a steady decline.
```{r waterbirds-results, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#plot the line of best fit
ggplot(moon_total, aes(Year, sum)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

# summary(moon.lm) #(F=5.33, R-squared=0.11, p=0.03)
# confint(moon.lm) #intervals for the slope do not include 0
# predict(moon.lm, list(Year = 2030)) #2030 is the last predicted year for waterbird populations given the current rate of decline

tab_model(
  moon.lm,
  show.est=TRUE, show.ci=FALSE, show.se=TRUE, show.p=TRUE,
  col.order = c("est", "se", "p"),
  pred.labels = c("Intercept", "Year"),
  dv.labels = c("Abundance"),
  string.p = "P-Value",
          string.est = "Estimate",
          string.se = "Standard Error",
          string.ci = "Conf. Int (95%)"
)
```

## Pelican abundance at Lake Moondarra
The above model does not take into consideration variability between species, but rather looks at waterbirds in general. I've chosen to analyse Pelicans specifically, as they are a charismatic species with a high observation count in the previous figure and whose population is not endangered at a species level. 
```{r cute-pelicans, fig.cap="Cute Pelicans. Source: centralcoast.nsw.govt.au", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("data/pelicans.JPG")
```

In order to determine trends in pelican abundance I used a linear regression of sum of all pelican observations predicted by year of survey. I checked assumptions using the plot function and found that residuals were evenly dispersed and followed the QQ-plot.
```{r pelican-abundance, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#subset pelican observations
pel_abund <- bird %>%
  filter(Wetland == "Lake Moondarra" & Common.Name=="Pelican") %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(sum=sum(Bird.Count))

#find equation for the regression line
pel.lm <- lm(sum ~ Year, #sum predicted by year
              data = pel_abund)

#checking assumptions
plot(pel.lm)
```
The abundance of pelicans has been decreasing at Lake Moondarra across the years surveyed (F=9.55, R-squared=0.2, p<0.01). The results of this model are visualised , showing a steady decline. The results of the Pelican abundance model has a higher F-statistic and lower R-squared than the model with all waterbirds. The F-statitic result tells us that there is less variation from the line of best fit in the Pelican abundance than for waterbirds as a whole. The R-squared result is still quite low (closer to 0 than 1), which means that the points are quite close to the trend line. The Pelican model has a slightly higher R-squared than the waterbird model, suggesting that there is more noise in the data.

```{r pelican-results, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#plot the line of best fit
ggplot(pel_abund, aes(x=Year, y=sum)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm")

#tidy table
tab_model(
  pel.lm,
  show.est=TRUE, show.ci=FALSE, show.se=TRUE, show.p=TRUE,
  col.order = c("est", "se", "p"),
  pred.labels = c("Intercept", "Year"),
  dv.labels = c("Abundance"),
  string.p = "P-Value",
          string.est = "Estimate",
          string.se = "Standard Error",
          string.ci = "Conf. Int (95%)"
)

# summary(pel.lm) #(F=9.55, R-squared=0.2, p<0.01)
# confint(pel.lm) #intervals for the slope do not include 0
# predict(pel.lm, list(Year = 2035)) #2035 is the last predicted year for pelican population given the current rate of decline
```

# Conclusion

 While waterbird populations are currently healthy at Lake Moondarra, observation data over the past 35 years shows a steady decline in abundance. While further research is needed to determine the causes of this decline, the waterbird populations can be an indicator of stress to the ecosystem as a whole.
